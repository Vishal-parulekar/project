# Credit Card Spending Prediction with Machine Learning

This project is a part of Capstone Project during my **Data Engineering Certification** Training with The Center of Applied Data Science (CADS).
A group project of 5 people led by me, this project focuses on **Data Cleaning** and **Data Prediction** using Machine Learning on Credit Card Customers data[^1]. 
The process involved in this project includes: 

1. Data wrangling with **Python**, **Pandas**.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis and visualization with **seaborn** and **matplotlib**.
3. Modelling using **scikit-learn** (RandomForestRegressor).

All process was compiled in [this Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/FatehaRozy/credit-card-prediction/blob/main/Credit%20Card%20Spend%20prediction%20_%20Key%20Drivers%20SC.ipynb).

[^1]: Data used is a mock data and have been permitted to be used in students' portfolio.

ðŸ“Œ Note from Author: As this is one of my first projects ever, it's admittedly a *bit* messy. I chose not to alter any as a reference for my growth in the future.
